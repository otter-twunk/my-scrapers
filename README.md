# My Scrapers

This repo groups Stash scrapers by site, with one folder per scraper.

## Start Here

If you are creating a new scraper, use these files in order:

1. `START_HERE.md`
2. `workflow/PERPLEXITY_RESEARCH_INPUT.md`
3. `workflow/PERPLEXITY_GENERIC_REPO_BRIEF.md`
4. Have Perplexity use the generic repo brief to choose `scrapers/<site-folder>/`, scaffold that folder, and populate it, especially `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`, `PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md`, and `CODEX_PROMPT.md`
5. `workflow/NEW_SCRAPER_CHECKLIST.md`

If you want Codex to build directly without a separate research pass, use:

- `workflow/CODEX_PROMPT.md`

## Layout

Each scraper lives in:

- `scrapers/<site-folder>/`

Each scraper folder should contain:

- the Stash scraper `.yml`
- the backing Python script
- a short `README.md`
- `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`
- `PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md`
- `CODEX_PROMPT.md`
- `TODO.md`

Current scrapers:

- `scrapers/justthegays-tv`
- `scrapers/justthegays-com`

## Workflow

### Recommended Flow

1. Run the Perplexity research brief in `workflow/PERPLEXITY_RESEARCH_INPUT.md`.
2. Have Perplexity apply the repo conventions, choose `scrapers/<site-folder>/`, and scaffold the folder.
3. Have Perplexity fill in `SCRAPER_SPEC.json` and write folder-specific `PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md` and `CODEX_PROMPT.md`.
4. Ask Codex to start from the files inside that scraper folder.
5. Validate and publish with `workflow/NEW_SCRAPER_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Direct Codex Flow

1. Use `workflow/CODEX_PROMPT.md`.
2. Point Codex at this repo.
3. Have it create the scraper from `templates/site-template/`.

## Add a New Scraper Manually

1. Copy `templates/site-template/`.
2. Rename the folder to `scrapers/<site-folder>/`.
3. Rename the template files for the target site.
4. Fill in `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`.
5. Update the folder-local `PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md` and `CODEX_PROMPT.md`.
6. Implement the scraper logic.
7. Test against live scene and performer pages when possible.
8. Update this README with the new scraper folder.

## Stash Install

For any scraper in this repo:

1. Copy that scraper's `.yml` and script file into your Stash `scrapers` directory.
2. Reload scrapers in Stash or restart the app.

## Conventions

- One site per scraper.
- Prefer Python-backed script scrapers.
- Keep folder names short and URL-safe.
- Keep structured scraper research in `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`.
- Document supported scrape modes in each scraper README.
- Preserve existing scraper behavior when adding new ones.

## Workflow Files

- `START_HERE.md`: one-page overview of the whole process
- `workflow/PERPLEXITY_RESEARCH_INPUT.md`: research brief for Perplexity
- `workflow/PERPLEXITY_GENERIC_REPO_BRIEF.md`: generic repo rules for Perplexity scaffolding
- `workflow/PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md`: repo-level handoff template
- `workflow/CODEX_PROMPT.md`: repo-level direct Codex prompt
- `workflow/NEW_SCRAPER_CHECKLIST.md`: QA and publish checklist
- `workflow/SIMPLE_CODEX_START.md`: minimal prompt to start Codex from a scraper folder
- `scripts/create_scraper_from_template.sh`: optional local fallback for scaffolding
- `scripts/validate_scraper_repo.py`: checks folder structure and required files

## Folder-Local Workflow Files

Each scraper folder can also include:

- `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`: machine-friendly research and implementation contract
- `PERPLEXITY_TO_CODEX_HANDOFF.md`: site-specific handoff for Codex
- `CODEX_PROMPT.md`: site-specific direct Codex prompt
- `TODO.md`: implementation progress checklist

The recommended automated flow is to have Perplexity choose the scraper folder, scaffold it from repo conventions, populate `SCRAPER_SPEC.json`, and draft the folder-local workflow files before Codex starts implementation.
